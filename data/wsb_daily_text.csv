People think the dollar got stronger. What happened here is the Fed agreed to borrow some more money out from the financial institutions by writing IOUs. The IOUs will be bought back at a higher price by the FED. Here’s how the conversation went. Banking Institutions: Aye yo big brother, I got too much stimmys in storage. Got anything for me to buy? FED: They arnt throwing it in the stock market?! How much this time? Institutions: Not much just 752bn FED: alright park the cash here. I’ll write up something for you. Scribbles IOU. Face value $756bn, interest 0.5%. Institutions: wicked, so much better than bag holding. Here’s $752bn. 14 days later - printer turns on. $1bn, $2bn, $3bn, $4bn. FEDs - stonks only go up until 2023.

Here's an example of one of the fake media outlets saying ford dropped qnx  The truth is.....NO, Ford did NOTTT drop blackberry QNX they switched to QNX Hypervisor Each car has 100 Electrical Control Unit (ECU) performing all the smart functions from automatic brake to rear view camera to seat belt checks to acceleration to lane change etc....blah blah blah. ONE of hundred ECU runs the infotainment of the car. The infotainment is the unit used to change your music radio etc...THE NON CRITICAL AND SAFETY FUNCTION OF THE CAR. SO IF INFOTAINMENT CRAPS OUT WHILE DRIVING NO ONE WILL GET HURT OR DIE. Ford essentially is dropping blackberry QNX to go with google android. BUT, remember car companies are consolidating ECU to reduce number of chips they need, so FORD instead is using Blackberry QNX Hypervisor on the chip and running android on top. The hypervisor runs the infotainment(fm/am radio etc) and the instrument cluster(speed gauge....critical stuff). Blackberry QNX Hypervisor () lets you run non-critical (google android) and critical (qnx for cluster) on the SAME CHIP Essentially Ford is paying more to use Blackberry Hypervisor. They chose this route becuase they don't want to continue developing the infotainment portion in-house due to cost. they're out sourcing it to google...this is a non-critical function inside the car that no one care if it fails. For everything else inside the car QNX is used extensively because it's the only ASIL-D certified software.  Google and Blackberry are working together for this infotainment portion. If you read this article it specifically refers to Hypervisor. Basically android will be running on BB QNX Hypervisor You can't run cars on android Every piece of critical ECU inside the car including the modem that connect to the internet is running Blackberry QNX.      Summary: It's bunch of FUD that Ford dropped QNX. In fact Ford has switched from Blackberry QNX to Blackberry QNX Hypervisor. The BB hypervisor will run non-critical/non-safe android on top for the infotainment function. So please stop this fake stuff about how ford dropped BB. There are 400 Blackberry employees working at Ford design lab  These employees are working on Ford connected car using BB technology. Ford drop blackberry qnx for google android? really?"

This is meant to be someone in this shit trying to get an answer from others that may know the situation better than myself. I posted this at another place full of  experts  and got ran out of town for 'trying to strike fear into the market.' As if there isn't 8000 other things going on that is accomplishing that just fine. /disclaimer Let's start with the SIPC's statement on hacks and how they affect what they insure: https://i.imgur.com/hKGC2Pg.png If I'm reading that correctly, they don't? I've reached out for clarification in the event of a wide-spread hack/cyberattack but haven't heard back at the time of this post. So.. with cyberattacks being a hot topic lately in the news I was thinking after close today; hypothetically, what if next week the market was halted? Say for an entire week. What would happen on the following Monday at market open? Would all derivatives that expired during the halt be worthless? Would the ensuing panic possibly get some very shady financial institutions out of some very big holes? What if brokerage's records become corrupted? Would Cede have the paper/digital records of who owned what and reimburse lost shares? Lost options? What happens to ITM strikes? The World Economic Forum is holding their annual exercise to address and implement some actions in the event of such attacks on July 9th. It's called ""Cyber Polygon."" Maybe someone more familiar with their event knows how well protected our securities are? https://www.weforum.org/projects/cyber-polygon It's a huge what-if scenario that I'm sure is practiced against daily.. but it is a big damn ""what if?"" I'll list some articles below that caught my eye with regards to such a thing happening. If pipelines can be halted, and meat production facilities can be halted, and other country's exchanges can be halted in the name of ""cyber attacks,"" where do we stand as retail investors on the NYSE? Hopefully WSB has some expertise in the matter. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-04/how-a-dated-cyber-attack-brought-a-stock-exchange-to-its-knees https://www.investopedia.com/news/are-your-stocks-danger-getting-hacked/ https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/04/14/could-the-next-stock-market-crash-be-potentially-caused-by-a-cyberattack/.

1216339,o374vm,2021-06-19,"Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, or hedgefund shill trying to distract you from AMC, you fuckin monkeys. Alright boys and girls, listen the fuck up cause I'm going to get straight to the point. Currently estimated 60% Short Interest, with a market cap just below 2 billion and float of 112.69M.  So now what the fuck does this mean? Let's compare to AMC. AMC currently have a market cap of 30 BILLION with a float of 448.49 MILLION and only 13.45% Short Interest as of last Friday. Now because the float &amp; market cap of WKHS is much lower, it takes significantly less bananas to get the rocket ship going. WKHS only needs a mere fucking fraction of the volume AMC saw for it to see a Thanos Infinity Squeeze and fuck the shorts to kingdom come.  Technical Analysis  Now listen here you fucks, I do have data to back this up. ORTEX send out trading signals based on algorithmic backtesting or some bullshit like that. They sent out a Short Squeeze Signal on June 10th, which according to them you are likely to see the highest returns 11 days after the signal was fired, which would be on the 25th of June.  So now, let's compare the ORTEX data now with the previous squeeze.  Looking at the previous squeeze that occurred on the 26th of Jan, we can see that it gapped up to a high of $42.96 on just 33% Short Interest. Now imagine what the fuck we could do with 60%. How I see it is, we are so close to seeing a huge run up to at least $30. For you monkeys that don't math, that's a +100% gain, and anyone will the balls to yolo options you'll see significantly more. I don't know why I don't see anyone posting their positions anymore but here they are: 120x Jul 16 45/60 Bull Debit Spreads 1x Jun 25 15.5c 2x Jun 25 16c 5x Jul 02 18c 50 Shares TLDR: WKHS has 60% Short Interest and is the next trip to the fucking moon..

1216427,o394od,2021-06-19,"Hello id like to preface by saying I’m a pretty stupid kid invested in gme and amc since January but have had this on my mind for a while. To start I know a lot of us have watched the big short so if you haven’t this post may not make sense. I think this has all been a well orchestrated game by the hedge funds. So GameStop was this huge squeeze bringing media attention to the stock market for people who wanted to make money right? Then it was halted causing another mass inflow of investors who were justice seekers and wanted to prove a point? Suddenly all these other heavily shorted stocks popped up, but if we just “caught them vulnerable” would they really have kept or opened up all these other positions in other companies? Second, we are currently in a housing bubble. 2008 was a result of shit mortgage bonds going tits up, those same style mortgages were renamed and reintroduced in 2015 as bespoke tranche opportunities. We all know those who went short on the housing market profited billions off the collapse and the banks were held responsible for their shitty mortgages, and 5 trillion dollars in pensions, retirements and 401ks vanished of the face of the earth. Citadel has a large ownership in blackrock and they are clearly in bed together. Blackrock has been buying up all the real estate it can get its hands on for 50% above ask. Ask yourself this, why would a money making company like blackrock invest heavily into real estate before a predicted housing market crash? Vanguard one of the leading funds for retirements and pensions is also involved in this play, coincidence? Tl:dr I think we’re being used as the black sheep to crash the market and take the blame while insurance covers these hedge funds and they make billions on the side from betting against the market. The government will step in with a billion dollar stimulus comprised of our capital gains tac saving banks and hedge funds. And theyll offer these shitty mortgages to people down on their luck and start the timer again. The fed and banks will be heroes, hedge funds and the average American will be victims and we the apes will be painted as villains. Just my two cents.. Tin foil hat theory"

That being said, let’s get into the fucking action. Start downing your redbulls now, and be prepared to go on a 10 hour bender of harassing users on r/conspiracy, because this shit is about to get pretty far-fetched. The man of the hour is Mr. Lloyd Austin. This 6 foot 1, 210 pound gigachad of a man is a decorated former US 4-star general. In other words, buddy gets more pussy during his morning breakfast than you’ll get in your entire life. When he’s not blowing up freedomless boneheads at the push of a button, he’s dipping his massive cock into the finance game. After retiring in 2016, he found himself on the boards of Raytheon, Nucor, and Tenet Healthcare. However, this absolute machine of a man is never satisfied. Lloyd Austin eats, sleeps, breathes, and shits freedom. His brief retirement ended when he was appointed as Secretary of Defense under Joe Biden. That’s really my whole argument to convince you to waste your money on these 3 stocks. Maybe show this shit to your alt-right and/or schizophrenic friends, they’ll understand where I’m going with this. There is no doubt in my mind that Lloyd is gonna look out for his guys. General motherfucking Austin didn’t make it all the way to the White House for nothing. If he doesn’t pull some corrupt shit to benefit the boys, I’ll be thoroughly disappointed. As the first African-American to serve as Secretary of Defense, it’s about fucking time that a black man gets to dish out some political favoritism. Let’s break it down: You’ve already seen the shitstorm surrounding RTX on this sub, so if you want some actual analysis, go find somebody on this who knows what they’re talking about, because that somebody is not me. I’m a simple man, and what I do know is we have a good old fashioned warmongering Dem back in the Oval Office, and he’s ready to tear some shit up overseas, plus Raytheon is already leading the pack in the business of killing people. Obvious buy and hold. Now Nucor. No doubt, total boomer stock. Your grandpa probably still owns shares of steel companies. But fuck it, the DOW has been on a tear lately, and NUE is projecting record earnings for this upcoming quarter. That’s all I need to hear, my underdeveloped brain says BUY BUY BUY. Tenet Healthcare. Honestly I have no clue about this one. All I know is that healthcare is generally a bit undervalued right now, but more importantly, the ticker symbol is THC. What more do you need?? Buy it. That’s all I got for you boys. Hopefully somebody who passed microeconomics 101 can analyze this in expert-level detail. Please share your thoughts and worthless opinions below.. Break out the tinfoil hats. RTX, NUE, and THC to the fucking cosmos."

1216463,o39xo8,2021-06-19,"The hardest part of investing is controlling your emotions. If you don't know how to do that, then you might sell your stonks too early because you got scared off, or hesitate to buy - and then miss a huge run-up. That's especially important when your stonks go down in value and you start seeing a ton of red in your account.. Here are three quotes that really helped me get control of my mental game. Each of them covers a slightly different aspect. Read them, understand them, combine them in your mind, and your profits should get a lot better. :) First, this long but awesome quote from Warren Buffett, all the way back in his 1987 letter to shareholders: ""Ben Graham, my friend and teacher, long ago described the mental attitude toward market fluctuations that I believe to be most conducive to investment success. He said that you should imagine market quotations as coming from a remarkably accommodating fellow named Mr. Market who is your partner in a private business. Without fail, Mr. Market appears daily and names a price at which he will either buy your interest or sell you his. Even though the business that the two of you own may have economic characteristics that are stable, Mr. Market’s quotations will be anything but. For, sad to say, the poor fellow has incurable emotional problems. At times he feels euphoric and can see only the favorable factors affecting the business. When in that mood, he names a very high buy-sell price because he fears that you will snap up his interest and rob him of imminent gains. At other times he is depressed and can see nothing but trouble ahead for both the business and the world. On these occasions he will name a very low price, since he is terrified that you will unload your interest on him. Mr. Market has another endearing characteristic: He doesn’t mind being ignored. If his quotation is uninteresting to you today, he will be back with a new one tomorrow. Transactions are strictly at your option. Under these conditions, the more manic-depressive his behavior, the better for you. But, like Cinderella at the ball, you must heed one warning or everything will turn into pumpkins and mice: Mr. Market is there to serve you, not to guide you. It is his pocketbook, not his wisdom, that you will find useful. If he shows up some day in a particularly foolish mood, you are free to ignore him or to take advantage of him, but it will be disastrous if you fall under his influence. Indeed, if you aren’t certain that you understand and can value your business far better than Mr. Market, you don’t belong in the game. As they say in poker, “If you’ve been in the game 30 minutes and you don’t know who the patsy is, you’re the patsy. An investor will succeed by coupling good business judgment with an ability to insulate his thoughts and behavior from the super-contagious emotions that swirl about the marketplace. In my own efforts to stay insulated, I have found it highly useful to keep Ben’s Mr. Market concept firmly in mind.”  Second, the famous Litany Against Fear from Dune, one of the best sci-fi books of all time: ""I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past, I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.""  Last but not least, my personal favourite - by Covetous Shen from Diablo-3. :) ""Hope... Do not look down, my friend. Even in the darkest of times, there is always hope. Hope for a better day, hope for a new dawn. Or just hope for a good breakfast. You start small, then see what you can get."" Good luck - I hope this helped you. If you do end up making some extra cash off this advice, no need to thank me - just give some cash to your local charity. :) Or, if you're in Seattle or Toronto, let's hang out! The cider is on you hahaha Oh, and since this is WSB: 🦍 🦍 🦍 🦍 🦍 🍌 🍌 🍌 🍌 🍌 🍌 🍌 🚀🚀🚀 🌓 🍆 💦 💦 💦. Three awesome quotes that will help you keep your cool when your stonks drop in value"

Since hitting that high in early January, the stock has been more than halved and it was sitting at $43 when the market closed on Tuesday. That's when Morgan Stanley showed up with a glowing note that made the point that electric vehicle adoption over the next decade represents a big opportunity for SUNRUN as EV sales beget rooftop sales. TBD is whether MS is drunk on Kool-Aid but in the meantime, its tout helped push the stock 10.5% higher on Wednesday. The stock was up another 9.3% yesterday and as importantly, it traded 25m shares. This total is more than RUN has ever traded and with 17% of the float sold short, it feels as if SUNRUN has quietly become a meme stock. It turns out that is the case as someone named KTRollercoaster pitched SUN yesterday to the Apes who get their cues on Wall Street Bets. We didn't see this garner much attention yesterday. Perhaps that is because the stock was ONLY up 10%, not 20%. And volume topped out at 25m shares, not 50m. In any event, it looks to us like Morgan Stanley got this ball rolling and in the process, it may have catalyzed an Ape Raid.. SUNRUN - RUN to the sun ALL IN ALERT"

1216631,o3g0cg,2021-06-19,"First look at the charts. On Friday Wish closed above the 50 SMA for the first time since trading publicly. This is a sign of technical strenh and big buying signal. This means wish will show up in more bullish stock screeners and it likely will cause some short algos to quit selling the stock and run for the hills. The large downtrend that has been in place since February has now clearly been broken. Last weekend I saw some posts that drew the downtrend line slightly higher and they argued Wish hadn’t broken out yet and still needs to prove itself. Now, clearly, no matter how you draw the trend line, it has been broken. Not to mention, Quad witching, which included June monthly options expiration, was yesterday which means that wall of expiring options is no longer hanging over the stock. The next obvious resistance is around $15 and I expect we head back there this week. Whether we break through without a fight or we stop and consolidate for a while remains to be seen. IMO this thing is obviously heading back to the IPO price of $24, but I personally won’t be trimming until we get a new all time high over $32. As for the fundamentals, they improved this week as well. IMO the way to value this company is as follows: Wish management has the following long term financial targets: -25-30% (of revenue) Cost of goods sold -40-45% sales and marketing expense -8-9% Gen &amp; Admin expense This implies long term net income margins of 16-27%. Analysts believe they will continue to grow revenue by 20-25% per year over the next several years. Looking out 5 years to 2026 if we assume conservatively: -19% annual revenue growth from 2021 projected $3.2 billion -15% net income margin in 2026 -We get $7.64 billion in revenue and $1.146 billion non gaap net income. Put a 30-35 p/e multiple on that and you can see that the fundamentals will be dragging the share price much much higher over time. And the market will be forecasting that net income a few years beforehand and will adjust the valuation higher accordingly. I did a similar analysis with Pinterest in 2019 when they went public on the thesis that Pinterest makes $1 billion in net income by 2024. I heard some of the same bearish arguments back then that I’m hearing about Wish. And now we see the market expects Pinterest to make $1.30 in EPS in 2022 (1 billion would be like $1.61..) None of these numbers include this new deal with Prestashop announced earlier this week: “Through this partnership, more than 300,000 merchants and brands on the PrestaShop platform will be able to quickly and easily sell to millions of consumers on the Wish marketplace. PrestaShop merchants will have free access to a direct integration module on the PrestaShop platform that connects them directly to Wish’s merchant dashboard. The module will sync their products and orders between PrestaShop and Wish. PrestaShop merchants will also benefit from a suite of additional marketing and sales support and a number of special incentives. Wish will enjoy official “Trusted Partner” status on PrestaShop and will benefit from a special landing page on the PrestaShop platform for merchants.” Wish will now have 300K more merchants selling on their platform. This improves the platform by offering new products for consumers and instantly fixes some of the criticisms that wish is just a bunch of low quality products from China. This will also come with MUCH more data for Wish to utilize. And some of these merchants will likely also use ProductBoost (advertising by wish) and Logistics. The Wish landing page link on the Prestashop platform is particularly valuable since it will lead many new consumers directly to wish. I’d like to remind everyone that the large rallies in 2020 for Pinterest and Facebook only occurred after they announced partnerships with Shopify... https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210614005463/en/Wish-Announces-Partnership-With-Leading-Ecommerce-Platform-PrestaShop Not financial advice I eat crayons yada yada yada Wish to the moon 🚀🚀. $Wish is going places (UP)"

First is Market Cap which shows that the other companies are shown to be worth more; Tilray by 4.6x, Canopy by 5.4x, and Aurora by 1.05x. Second is Price to Sales which shows the stock prices are at a significantly higher PS (If Sundial had the PS of Tilray, Sundial’s stock price would be around 14.63). Last is financials, which shows Sundial in comparison to the others has the best net income, operating income, and cost of revenue. While also having the second most cash on hand. The revenue is the worst of the four but this will improve overtime since Sundial has the largest growth prospects and potential. — Stock Value: Should be at least 2.50, but if it had the same price inflation as Canopy, Sundial’s share price would be 13+. — Involves no talk of squeeze or large run up. Just fundamental analysis and comparison to competitors in the United States &amp;amp;amp;amp; Canada. Not my post, Just information .

The company’s share price is likely to continue rising in the lead-up to the July 19 stock split. And investors wanting to cash in on short-term gains can ride the pre-split momentum to decent returns. Of course, Nvidia is not a bad long-term investment. Investors who own the company’s shares as of June 21 will participate in the stock split and receive a dividend of three additional common shares for every share they hold. Over the long-term, those shares can be expected to grow substantially. Again the deadline is this Monday to get in on the action to benefit from the split.. NVDA 4:1 Split"

This is why he fawns all over money managers and CEOs on tv while trashing the retail investor in the next breath. Then he faux supports the small guy while throwing tiny bits of shade at the wealthy. He tries to ingratiate himself with all market cohorts (including Santelli) because he sees himself as a beloved, unifying, peace making market icon. He fails to realize that it is exactly this duplicity and two-faced behavior that causes everyone to hate him. He acts as if he embraces the self-assigned title of 'most hated man', but it is clearly destroying his ego. His attitude towards the WSB crowd illustrates his desperate attempt at relevancy. He tries to explain WSB to the masses, but he cannot because he is too slow to follow them and lacks the credibility to lead them. One day, he tells them to stick to AMC and GME. The next day he tells them to diversify away from those two stocks. It is sad to watch. Jim, you will never be Mark Haines. His legacy was calling a market bottom during a crash on live television. Yours will be telling millions of people to hold onto Bear Stearns stock as it became worthless, annoyingly childish sound effects and chasing the WSB crowd around like a lost puppy.

1216720,o3hotd,2021-06-19,"Trying to figure out realistic NVIDIA targets. I understand the ARM deal is speculative at this point. It looks optimistic but I feel uncertain about the deal actually coming to fruition. Also, timing of a deal meeting timelines is uncertain. I understand the stock split won’t necessarily impact price targets. But maybe a price creep will occur once it splits? Nvidia is one of my favorite companies that I have invested in for a long time. I have a great deal of fun trading memes and speculative stocks as opportunities present themselves. (Go SUNRUN) I believe the stock will continue to grow with or without ARM deal coming to fruition. But it’s a long term horizon with incremental growth. (35% in the last month) Now that it’s above 740 with a fresh hit to 770, do you think it will hit 800 within a relatively short time or do you think a pullback is in the future before gaining ground? I know it’s not the typical flavor on here, but just a few things I wanted to bounce off the collective ape brain of wsb.. Realistic NVIDIA targets?"

The stock is reflecting \6y of continued operation followed by zero customer additions - meaning Sunrun will go out of business after that, which is nuts The rapid growth of EVs adoption will be a major source of upside and can create as much value as existing set of customers.

1216753,o3ibcj,2021-06-19,"I consider Canoo as one of those investments that are totally misjudged by the mass market. Only if you take the time to really dive into their technology, their products and their vision, then the real value will show. Unfortunately, as shareholders, I honestly believe we had to deal with one of the toughest roads of all post-SPAC plays. Getting pummeled for months and months. Not particularly because of the share price (who cares in the short term) but because the company was pivoting hard, while not giving enough details through March - May for shareholders to keep their confidence. However, the earnings call in May and the Investor Day sealed it for me: Canoo is on it's way to become a strong global player in the EV ecosystem (not just car manufacturing). The most important take-aways for me were the following: » Manufacturing deal is done, and it sounds better than I hoped for. Our own factory with $300 million dollars in incentives, operational in Q4 2023, in one of the most energy-neutral states in the USA (please correct me if I'm wrong), with a government who really want to support a strong EV company in their location. » The partnership with VDL Nedcar is excellent. Being from that region myself, I know VDL decently well. They have been doing contract work for many, many years for large automotive companies. VDL Nedcar is a staple and a very important company for the region. They are the real deal. Canoo has been getting a lot of attention in the news here. Added value that this gives direct exposure in the European market, way earlier than I anticipated. As Tony said, that after the first models are sold in Q4 2022 in the USA, Europa will soon follow. » Their confirmation that they have the capital to bring the Lifestyle Vehicle to market is very re-assuring. Especially as they explained their calculations and thought proces, instead of just saying 'oh yeah sure, we got this'. » Their focus on data and technology is interesting. I am a bit skeptical about the expected addressable market and their math. But I am excited that they want to build an EV ecosystem, instead just cars. Although I am hoping they are not spreading their focus too much. » Their subscription model might be less important than before, but the business model regarding the 1st to 4th owner is underappreciated. I don't see any other car maker focus on the next owners. Canoo understands very well that they can be part of the customer journey and add value over the entire lifespan of the vehicle, getting revenue after after resale or wanted upgrade / personalization. » I was also impressed by a couple of the other senior managers. Especially the chief manufacturing and the marketing guy. They really seem to know their stuff and seem genially passionate about their job. Als I have to give a compliment to Tony, who is taking on a more humble approach than during his first earnings call. Guess we are not just seeing the company grow up before our eyes, but also the people involved. I am looking forward to the future and are staying heavily invested in Canoo, if they keep true to their promises and roadmap. Wishing you all the confidence to join the ride as OG Canoobro's and hopefully one day, we can look back and tell our friends that we saw the potential early on. Until the share price goes up so much, you don't want people to know you are a millionaire. ). Why I am more bullish about the lonerm future of Canoo"

1216819,o3jnh1,2021-06-19,"To start, and As Always, I never give financial advice and this is not different. People ask why there is so much DDs about WISH Well, basically it was never a meme stock, there is no need to make memes about it to make it attractive, the approach is purely fundamental, and to explain that , there is no better way than a DD. Now, I will try to explain why we believe (me and my wife) that WISH is going to moon and it’s just the beginning, trying not to talk about all the fundamentals and the points we already know. 1- As we can see in chart, for last week WISH was consolidating wating the 18/06 options to expire, The great thing about this consolidation is that it’s done with a verry hight volume (one of the highest on the market). In addition, Friday it closed above the 50 MA line. All these points are a verry strong bullish signs I believe.   2- I don’t know if you were following what happened Friday, I think it was a war between buyers and sellers, The big boys did all what they could to push it down below 12$ , because they knew it could be a disaster for them if it went above 12.5$ (verry Hight open interest in the 12.5$ call options, that could cause a gamma/short squeeze ). So they succeeded controlling the price, But I think The Sell pressure will go down in the next weeks, because of risk/reward ratio is on the buyers side. 3- The general sentiment on the media is going positive, a lot of positive articles on different online websites. Explaining what we were explaining 4 weeks ago about how the company is under evaluated (PS : I’m the one who did the DD for his Wife 😉 ) 4 – The fact that even when WISH was at 7.5$, management did not tried to push it up or give any comments, could be a verry bullish sign, that means they are concentrated on the long term and don’t give that much consideration about the short term. 5- The partnership with Prestashop , that gives it access to more than 300 000 merchants who are already using Prestashop. 6- Verry hight volume for the July 16 call options (15$ and 20$ strikes) and even the 45$ strike have a hight volume than usual. 7- With All this points, their will be more and more people noticing the stock (both who are waiting for technical signs and who buy only based on fundamentals). And because of it’s current evaluation, it will be attractive even for the more conservative people, this is will make pressure on the Shorters, so we may see a decrease in the short interest in the next weeks. Finally, all this points are my believes, I may be right and I may be wrong. But I’m already All IN anyways (On stock and not on options)(and already shared my Yolo 4 weeks ago), I know I'm a half retard, but I came from a poor family, I dont mind if I lose it all, because I already know how it feels to be poor, and it's not that bad down their.. $WISH : 7 reasons why my wife thinks WISH will Moon soon"

1216826,o3jq00,2021-06-19,"TLDR- Alcohol never goes down. Stock market goes up? You drink in celebration of your obvious genius. Stock market goes down? You drink lamenting that you just ""timed it wrong"". This makes investing in alcohol a (no pun intended) no-brainer. As an introduction, $SAM owns Samuel Adams (Beer \[ticker matches the product, I know some of you care about that\]), Truly Hard Seltzer (Hard Seltzer will be the highlight of the ensuing paragraphs EDIT: eventually, kind of), Twisted Tea (yes they still make that), Angry Orchard (Cider), and Dogfish Head (IPA). On top of all this, they recently announced the establishment of an R&amp;D hub in Canada led by the former Director of Innovation at Canopy Growth (yeah, weeds too). They have alllllll the bases covered. $SAM has bottle-rocketed through the stratosphere the past 18 months. It's lowest point the week of January 6th 2020 it closed at $367.95 and reached an ATH of $1,349.98 two months prior to this post. It straight up laughed in the face of the pandemic, hitting $306.46 on March 16th 2020 (this represents a 16.71% decrease between the week of January 6th 2020 and March 16th 2020, meanwhile, SPY went down 29.75% between the week of January 6th 2020 and the week of March 16th 2020) and climbing to $522.33 by June 1st 2020 ($SAM went up by 70.44% while SPY went up 39.57% in the same time period). Not enough numbers? Don't worry, I have some more (idiots welcome to yawn through this one): Consensus estimate for earnings (yes, like actual dollars and cents, not like most of the stuff that gets posted here) for Q1 2021 was $2.61EPS. The correct answer for Q1 2021 was $5.26EPS Hit a bit recently because a single analyst dropped them from ""buy"" (very good) to neutral (if you bought, there is for sure still hope), as well as our favorite Jimbo Creamer recommending folks sell a few days back. The current analyst estimates (there are 15 covering the stock) on average rate $SAM a buy, with a high target of $1,800 and only one analyst thinking it will go below $1,000 (I know, I also despise Mormons). Recently glazed and held slightly above ""oversold"" on the one-year RSI the past few days. The most recent Nielsen scanner data documents gains for $SAM in the hard seltzer category reaching 30% market share in the last two weeks, primarily due to the launch of Truly Punch, which reached an impressive \7.0% market share of hard seltzer, well ahead of competitive launches and achieved within a few months of being distributed. Side Note- buy a Truly Punch. Drink it. Remark how it tastes OK. Maybe drink another one. I mean heck, it's Summer, drink another one after that. Wake up behind a Wendy's dumpster. Grab a six pack of Truly's. Rinse and repeat. Think about it- this isn't pieces of metal being pushed down hillsides, promises of clean graphite by 2029, or the company's CEO doing too much coke one night and YOLOing on Coirn. This is YOU buying ALCOHOL, which, while I'm confident some of you don't- quality of content on this sub suggests most of you are nursing a severe hangover right now. My Personal Opinion Of A Play: Q2 FY21 EPS expected to be announced July 22nd, 2021. August or September calls likely to go BRRRR. I went September because it's gonna be HOT until October and I am going to drink a Turly as soon as I hit the post button. My meager positions: 1 SAM $1,540 9/17 Call 1 SAM $1,320 9/17 Call.

CRSR, a premium American games hardware company, is one of the most undervalued plays that you’ve ever seen in a long time in the public markets. IPOed Sept. 23 at $17 a share and is almost double that Fair value is 73% away from the current price Analysts agree that the stock price is lower than it should be. Consistently, it has paid down its debt and increased revenue. This come August earnings, it will be the same story: Higher revenue and lowered debt. Hell, the market cap multiplier is below its competitors which is very odd. It is a catch now.  I haven’t seen anyone said they hate Corsair’s products or tramp on their quality. You know what? New products are coming especially with DDR5 busting out the gates. Dominator and Vengeance Memory modules are insanely profitable for Corsair With Dominator and Vengeance DDR5 rocketing performance by 2x, you fucking bet nerds, gamers and enthusiasts are going to the bat for Corsair Memory DDR5-6400 folks, 51 G/Bs Bandwidth is 2x more than the last generation. It is insane Check out the  where Corsair says ""More bandwidth allows for more efficient use of the memory bus in systems with high core count CPUs while the denser capacities will allow your system to tackle even more at once which is great for streaming and content creation (just to name a few applications).”  Who’s in the streaming business? You know it, CORSAIR The higher the performance, the better the streaming Corsair owns Elgato, which sells the whole streaming bundle getting content creators focused on providing the best content in the best environment without worrying about quality. Corsair is very serious about streaming after COVID. “80% of Corsair’s revenue comes from competitive gamers” according to a Seeking Alpha Article “Corsair Gaming: The Overlooked Winner Of The Gaming Boom.“ Esports and Twitch are not going away and are expected to keep growing. The 5G market continue to grow with telecoms expanding availability and phone manufacturers finally jumping on the 5G bandwagon. These are catalysts for the streaming market. The live streaming market is expected to grow globally by a Compound annual growth rate (CAGR) by 19% during 2019 - 2025 according to Kenneth Research . Soon, you will be able to go anywhere in the world and keep up with your favorite live streamer personality.  It is easy to blame WallStreetBets for the recent price spike, but we all have the same goal Apes took a shot and an insider coincidentally sold a bunch of shares and it would have happened without WSB. You shot your shot and are depressed as much as the stock has been. Don’t worry though, you reward is coming and all you have to do is believe in CRSR. More spikes are incoming for the short term because it has WSB attention, but we will stabilize and grow for the long term.  I am bullish for the short term and bullish on the long term. Corsair is widely agreed to be high quality and undervalued. You absolutely need this in your portfolio. FOMO if you want though  Hold for the long term, you will be severely rewarded.

Invest in SPCE The company (not sure I really need to lay this out but whatever) SPCE aims to be the worlds first “commercial spaceline and vertically integrated aerospace company”. Wut da hell does that actually mean? Short term, SPCE hope will basically act as a glorified rollercoaster for rich people to go into space and occasionally some scientist to conduct experiments. Over time they quite literally aim to be the taxi cab of space flight whether its transcontinental or a trip to an orbiting hotel/ laboratory. While yeah, we’re a fucking long way off from orbiting hotels, but this has already caught they eye of private research agencies whom might not have the capability to just go up in space. Ole daddy Branson is a visionary who is years beyond all the competition and is laying a foundation for what will inevitably become a lucrative business. While Space-x, Blue Balls Bezos, and every other rocket producing agency are focused on just that, producing rockets like fucking losers, SPCE is producing a taxi service for the cosmos (inserts picture of VSauce kissing daddy Tyson) The Financials These aren’t great so lets get it out of the way. \- R&amp;D expenses increased 19% YoY, good for growth \- In 2020 their revenues decreased 93.7%, the lost some government contracts \- Cash $665.9M’s to help cover their poor revenue The Game Plan \- Glorified taxi for scientist, rich people, and instruments \- Expansion of their proprietary and reusable rockets/ planes, which are much cheaper to fly BTW \- Increasing their R&amp;D and expanding government/ private contracts The Team \- Former NASA Chief of Staff and Chris Hadfield, this is all you need to know Risk \- Very poor financial performance (I believe that we are investing at the ground level and are investing into an idea/ vision rather than the current performance of the company) \- They have two more test flights and anymore failures will significantly slow progress and cause the share price to commit Seppuku \- Their very secretive with launch dates and PR team is garbage Upcoming Catalyst \- Upcoming FAA approval, pending 2 more test flights (both of which are planned in the coming months and after each successful flight the share price also launches into space \- Richard Branson plans on going on 1 of 2 upcoming test flights (he was gonna do this before bitch boi Bezos said he was) All in all, I believe that an investment in SPCE is buying into an idea rather than the company's current endeavors. This company is laying down a foundation for what will inevitably become a necessity for future travel. I believe SPCE is very forward thinking and that’s why I throw money at them. I am very drunk, been watching Billions, and legitimately I do not know what I’m talking about. I’m going to go throw up now, later losers. 500 shares @ 14.70 30c 21Jan22 x2 25c 20Jan23 x3.

She doesn’t even give me time to open my eyes and she says “who the hell is Robin!” I’m tired, haven’t had my morning poo or my Honey Nut Cheerios so of course I’m in no state of mind to understand what she means. I replied, “I don’t know any Robins”. She continues yelling at me telling me that I think she’s an idiot, that I’m talking to all of my friends about her and she knew that they were looking at her funny last time we hung out. So finally she throws the phone at me and says if you don’t want to be honest fine, I’ll just leave. So I’m up enough to read at this point, and when I look at my phone I had texted my buddy Ray, “I’m gonna get all up in Robin Hood Monday morning, I’m a horny bull for some XX and don’t worry I’m gonna XXXX off before I get home to my wife.” That was one of my more PG texts - as I’m sure my fellow apes can understand that I go hard on something when I believe it can make me that money (XX) - and when I believe in the company (XXXX). Anyways, 2 hours of convincing later I’m still married. However she now knows where all of our money is going - down the big fat drain. Not sure if I’ll get upvotes or down votes for that last part.

That these two cities saw their housing values fall the farthest in the nation in 08/09 is not an insignificant fact. Neither are sustainable in any sort of measure due to lack of water, rainfall, and now the inability to irrigate in sufficient water from the Colorado river. Farmers and agriculture from Texas to Oregon are for the first time in decades being told to fuck themselves, there are no outs and that they should look for other industries, crops or geographic locations. Electricity shortages have been an issue in CA for decades and are growing worse every year--what will the equivalent of water rolling blackouts, brownouts and shortages for cities, suburbs or developments do for these areas livability, appeal and ability to attract residents? Focus on Vegas Casinos as we know them in Vegas seem like they would suffer, as they need heads in beds and monkeys at the slots, but they're in the midst of moving online to greatly expand and simplify access for their customers, I think they'll be fine if not far more profitable this way in the long run. Things that seems like they would collapse would be housing prices, locally-focused property management companies and anything dependent on population or growth in the city. What else would you short? Focus on Phoenix Phoenix has the same water and housing forecast issue in my mind. Interestingly it's squarely in the middle of the next generation economy for electricity, solar and battery manufacturing. This will put upward pressure and support on housing as jobs that require humans to be local in these different areas will be critical to regional and national infrastructure and unlikely to be abandoned, even if they require inefficient solutions, going as far as trucking in water if it came to that. Still plenty of opportunity to shrink housing from its current state though. What else would you short? How to invest and take advantage? Neither city will see an immediate exodus, but long-term realities of human water requirements indicate the populations have to shrink. If you're going to short housing in these areas, what's the corresponding call? Housing in the NW(OR/WA/ID/MT)? Calls on bottled water Nestle &amp; KO? Texas and CA getting into desalination industry?. Permadrought is here in the west/sw. Long-term collapse or incredible mass-migration away from unsustainable metros seems inevitable. Profit? My 2nd grade hypothesis needs your investment ideas."

1217036,o3o9hy,2021-06-19,"Mods please flair shitpost. So as decent movies start to come out I went to the movie theater the first time last week. I went to my local Regal theater just because it's the closest theater to me. Boy was I disappointed. Was it understaffed? Yes. Was the air conditioning working? Not really. Was it clean? No. Was the popcorn good? No. Was the Coke good? NO BECAUSE THE SELL TRASH ASS PEPSI NOW. According to every study ever done, Coke is more popular than Pepsi in the US. According to the same study, Coke has a more loyal fan base. I can deal with bad popcorn or a warm room, BUT WHO TF WANT A BLUE PEPSI CUP WHEN THEY'RE AT A MOVIE?? Even my one friend who likes Pepsi admits that there's something wrong with having Pepsi at a movie theater. At the moment I saw the Pepsi sign I knew I was never going back to a Regal theater and will only go to the AMC further away from my house. Many more people will do the same. TLDR: Regal owns stock in AMC, so they started selling Pepsi so more people would go to AMC, increasing revenue, and boosting the stock price.. Why Regal Cinemas will be the reason AMC hits $100"

1217060,o3oqlf,2021-06-19,"Ok, you retarded apes. Let's face the facts. DD is dogshit around here. It does not accurately represent what it should be and does not present the proper legal disclaimers. As a semi-professional DD-Writer, myself, I believe that it is my duty to try and at least somewhat help you dumbass apes. Over the course of this post, I hope to create a picture of what DD is supposed to look like, as well as how to avoid responsibility when your shitty stock tanks 90% after you wrote 30 dogshit ""DDs"" per day on why it would ""go up 400% tomorrow"". --- Title --- When writing titles for Due Diligence posts, it is important to note that you must accurately encompass your entire work in a single phrase. This might sound hard - considering you're all illiterate - but it's easy. Let's start with the basics. Titles can vary based on the type of due diligence you are writing, but generally if you're writing analysis - fundamental or technical - you will be using the same type of title. The first word must indicate whether your analysis is 100% thorough and complete (1), or rather, if there are kinks that need to be worked out within it (2) (upcoming data, etc.). You all will most certainly be using (2). In the case of (2), you must start the title of your DD with the phrase ""Preliminary analysis"". ""Preliminary"" describes whether it is in progress or not (in this case it is) and ""analysis"" is analysis. After you have written this, you must then follow it up by saying ""...on [company name], [business structure abbreviation] ([INDEX]: [TICKER]). We write it like this to specify the company whose business we will be analyzing, as well as their home index and stock ticker. After this, we write who the DD is for. In the case of company analysis for that specific company, an investment bank will put the company they are analyzing in that region. Here's an example: ""Preliminary Analysis on ContextLogin, Inc. (NASDAQ: WISH) for The Special Committee of the Constituents at WallStreetBets"" --- Legal disclaimers --- When writing papers on stocks, it is important to note that any and all assumptions you make can be seen as a form of guaranteeing movement of a stock. For example, if I were to say, ""BlackBerry is looking like it's gonna jump 30% All in"", the law would consider me to be giving financial advice. It is always important to preface a piece of ""DD"" with the proper legal disclaimers, so as to prevent you from being prosecuted by illiterate apes when they lose money. Before you begin the body of your ""DD"", you must give two important disclaimers: 1.) I am not a financial, accounting, tax, or legal advisor (we'll elaborate on that one in a moment) 2.) This Due Diligence is made solely for fun/private usage, and should be considered as such. This ""DD"" is not meant to be considered as anything more than an opinion and should not be treated as definitive proof of any future events (past results are no guarantee of future performance). (we'll elaborate on this one after the first mention) I have been seeing people use the term ""I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice."" The worst part about this is the fact that it is usually added at the end of their DD. Here are a few guidelines: 1.) Add your disclaimers at the beginning of your DD. 2.) The first mentioned disclaimer should include information as to what qualifications you do NOT have. Most individuals just say either ""I am not a financial advisor"" and leave it at that, while others go a step further with ""I am not a financial or tax advisor."" The truth is that you need more than that. You must include a statement that says that you will not interfere with government authority and tax law, as well as disclosing what qualifications you do not have. And example of a proper (1) disclaimer would be: ""u/Some-other-guy-1 does not provide accounting, tax, or legal advice. Notwithstanding anything in this document to the contrary, and except as required to enable compliance with applicable securities law, you (and each of your fellow WallStreetBetters, apes, moderators, and other users) may disclose to any and all persons in the US federal income and state tax treatment and tax structure of the transaction and all materials of any kind (including tax opinions and other tax analyses) that are provided to you relating to such tax treatment and tax structure, without u/Some-other-guy-1 imposing any limitation of any kind."" 3.) The second mentioned disclaimer should include information that states that the DD you have written is preliminary and the stock you are doing DD on is subject to change. For example: ""The information in this presentation is based upon any information supplied to me and reflects prevailing conditions and my views as of this date, of which are suspect to Change. My estimates should be regarded as indicative, preliminary and for illustrative purposes only."" --- Body --- Writing proper DD comes with a set of requirements on coverage of certain topics. Topics you cover in your DD should include: 1.) Market perception 2.) How does X stock compare to other members of its sector? 3.) What are some of the potential market alternatives to X stock and how might they affect the value of X stock? 4.) What alternatives may be able to overtake X stock and how might we evaluate them? After you initiate these topics, you proceed to covering them in as much depth as possible, finding as many possible answers to them as possible. Add a bull AND bear case. If you can't find any negatives for your penny stock, you're delusional. --- Conclusion --- In conclusion, I hope that this bit of guidance helps increase the quality of DD on this subreddit. Thanks for sticking around - if you did - and have a nice day!. How to write proper DD"

1217073,o3ouph,2021-06-19,"\-- Not investment advice, just my opinion do your own research before investing and make sure you understand the risks. Magnachip is a company based in Korea that makes semiconductors and LCDs, as many of you might know the coronavirus caused many companies to cancel their semiconductor orders because consumers were buying less but this trend didn't last nearly as long as the companies had thought. This caused semiconductor companies to get way more orders than they were able to fill which caused a shortage. You can think of this shortage similarly to the ""toilet paper shortage"" when demand is too high people start hoarding which further increases the demand. Most semiconductor companies have their order books filled up for years to come and the demand will only return back to normal once the supply catches up with the demand. Therefore investing in most semiconductors company would be a decent play in my opinion, but what makes MX so special is that they are undervalued compared to the rest third sector and that a buyout is likely to occur Currently, MX has one offer for 29$ pr share and another offer for 35$ per share. The 35$ offer is in part by a Chinese company therefore the 35$ offer would need approval by the Korean government and is currently being investigated by CIFUS, this investigation is likely to take 45-90 days. The current price of MX is 24.13. There are also some rumors that another firm might give a bid but this is currently only a rumor In, but in the best case scenario a bidding war could get going. Currently, I'm holding a lot of shares and will likely add options once the CFIUS investigation gets closer to being completed.. $MX Magnachip god-like DD"

1217132,o3pntj,2021-06-19,"Really favorable bullish technical setup going on in $PLTR right now. Also some confluence with a rotation into speculative growth/disruptors - which we haven't seen happen in quite a while. \---  I'll break this down color by color to make it easy for you all to understand\ (RED) This is a descending channel dating back to February. During the week of 6/1 - we managed to break it up. You will notice many other ""meme"" stocks broke a similar setup recently before launching. Notice the gap right at 31.30. Gaps in the upper direction are (almost) always filled. We can logically conclude the goal of this descending channel break is to finally fill that gap - before deciding the next move. (TEAL) Here we have an ascending wedge coming from upside. These patterns have a bullish bias. It's not uncommon to see a small wedge/channel form on the breakout from a larger pattern. In fact - it's actually quite bullish. If we get a daily close above the upper teal line - sitting around 25.87 on Monday - it would then ""break out"", and likely trigger a much more volatile move towards that gap at 31.34. (GREEN) Volume is trending upwards as the ascending wedge trends upwards. This is supportive of the trend and a bullish data point. (YELLOW) These are key price levels near the setup. When we are below, they are resistance - when we are above, they are support. As you can see - the nearest support below the wedge isn't until 22.70. On a failed breakout - it's likely we don't stop dropping until we hit this. For the upside - the nearest resistance isn't until 29.94 - this is actually a thick supply zone with multiple levels. While it's likely we go the distance and fill that gap at 31.34 - I would unload a good bit of your position at this resistance. \--- (ENTRIES) There are two optimal entries for this setup - 1. On a trip to that point of control @ 24.53. This is where the most business has been done in the past year and buyers/sellers like to reposition here. It's also the low end of the wedge \- which means below this (on a daily close) - you would look to exit, if you took this entry. This provides a very tight and favorable margin of error. 2. On a daily candle close above that upper teal line - @ 25.87 Monday - sloping up each day by about 0.06. You would then stop out if we got a daily candle close below that same line - also providing a nice margin of error. (EXITS) 1. If you took entry 1 - you would stop out on a daily candle close below 24.53. 2. If you took entry 2 - you would stop out on a daily candle close below the teal line around 25.87 Monday sloping up each day by about 0.06. Both entries would target 29.94 (take 3/4 off) and then that gap at 31.34 (I would exit here). \--- (POSITION IDEAS) Safe: 08/20/2021 PLTR 30c Risky: 07/16/2021 PLTR 30c \--- Keep in mind technical analysis is a road map, not a crystal ball. I'm providing the most high probability entries &amp; exits - with the most favorable risk/reward ratios. I am not making an absolute prediction of future prices.

I believe NVDIA will reach 800 pre-split (200 post 4-1 split) with the current momentum going for the stock along with a shift to tech soon. If you didn't know already, NVIDIA designs graphics processing units for the gaming and professional markets, as well as system on a chip units for the mobile computing and automotive market. EARNINGS NVIDIA recently had its earnings report in which they reported $3.66 earnings per share for the quarter, beating the consensus estimate of $3.28 by $0.38. They recorded revenue of $5.66 billion, up 84 percent from a year earlier and up 13 percent from the previous quarter, with record revenue from the company’s Gaming, Data Center and Professional Visualization platforms. Gaming revenue of $2.76 billion, up 106 percent from a year earlier. Record Data Center revenue of $2.05 billion, up 79 percent from a year earlier.  Quarterly Earnings Surprise Amount Fiscal Quarter End  Date Reported   Earnings Per Share\  Consensus EPS\ Forecast   % Surprise Apr 2021. 05/26/2021 3.13 2.62 19.47% Jan 2021 02/24/2021 2.58 2.2 17.27% Oct 2020 11/18/2020 2.41 1.92 25.52% Jul 2020 08/19/2020 1.67 1.63 2.45% As you can see over the past four quarterly earnings NVDIA has beaten each of the projected forecasts easily for the most part. With a gross margin of 64.11% for this quarter, and an average quarterly gross margin of 60.96% over the past 5 years, NVDIA is primed to continue its dominance for the future. Also it is important to note that NVDIA beats out its main competitors Intel and AMD in gross margins on average over the past 5 years and over the last quarter.  NVDIA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Range, Past 5 Years Minimum 54.74% Jan 2019 Maximum 65.06% Apr 2020 Average 60.96%  AMD Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Range, Past 5 Years Minimum 4.51% Sep 2016 Maximum 46.07% Mar 2021 Average 37.34%  Intel Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Range, Past 5 Years Minimum 53.13% Sep 2020 Maximum 64.50% Sep 2018 Average 59.65% Now onto reasons why I think NVIDIA is a strong buy. 1. Price targets NVDIA is still undervalued with multiple price targets very much higher than the current price of what NVDIA is trading at currently along with multiple buy ratings. One example in specific, Bank of America recently upgraded NVDIA price target to $900 from $800 and reiterated its Buy rating. The bank said its takeaway is that ""rising AI adoption, expanding use-cases across cloud, enterprise, edge, telco can help NVDA double its content and triple its data center sales over the next few years."" Bank of America said it expects NVIDIA's data center business to grow at a 35% compounded rate to become its largest segment by year-end 2025. Other notable price targets include 854- Jefferies, 800- Robert W Baird, 800- Rosenblatt Securities. 1. Acquisition of ARM ARM can’t stay independent for long, even the CEO thinks so. Arm CEO Simon Segars made the case that if it stays independent, Arm wouldn’t be able to keep up with the increasing demands of its customers for more complex chips that can perform a wider variety of functions. The simple solution? Getting acquired by another company. NVIDIA seems to be in the lead to acquire ARM and other rivals are terrified. They have a good reason to be, as NVDIA already a strong leader wants to spend $40 billion to acquire U.K. chip technology provider Arm Holdings. This acquisition will reshape the industry entirely. NVIDIA CEO, Jensen Huang said the acquisition of ARM is an opportunity to create a company that can generate even more new ideas, and bring more innovation to its customers in the form of intellectual property. A quote in specific, “The benefit to the market, and to the Arm customers will be more IP, better IP, more accelerated road maps and hopefully taking Arm to the far reaches of what is becoming …the diversity of computing that is literally going in every single direction,” Huang said. “You’re covering everything from cloud, to edge, to \[internet of things\], to high performance computing, to microprocessors, to accelerated computing—everything.” 2. Internet currency ( Not allowed to say actual word so replaced it with internet) GPU’s can be used for internet currency and its mining purposes. It’s possible to blame the graphic card shortage on these miners but nonetheless, the usage of them is highly prevalent today. NVIDIA's releases of processors specifically used for mining poses a huge boost to its revenue and to the internet currency world. NVIDIA booked $155 million in revenue from CMP cards in its fiscal first quarter. While internet money is gaining traction around the world, we can expect NVIDIA to continue its dominance and reliability in mining purposes. 3. Stock split On May 21st, NVIDIA announced a 4-1 stock split which would take place on July 19th. So for every one share you own, you will own four instead as the stock splits its price valuation by four. On the day of the news, NVIDIA’s stock price closed at $599.67. Since then, the price of NVIDIA’s stock has gone up around 24% to $743.75. Not even one month has passed and the stock is up 24%! With one full month until the split I predict NVDIA to hit $800 or/and above by the time of the official split. Call options and shares in my opinion are the way to go for the next month as this could be a great opportunity to invest in a fast growth company. 4. Growth NVIDIA has been a great growth tech stock to own recently with the numbers backing this statement up. NVIDIA RETURNS YTD: +223.35 (+42.77%) 1 Year: +376.83 (+102.20%) 6 Months: +214.67 (+40.44%) 1 Month: +184.92 (+32.98%) Now for the returns on NVIDIA compared to AMD and INTEL. NVIDIA RETURNS YTD: +223.35 (+42.77%) 1 Year: +376.83 (+102.20%) 6 Months: +214.67 (+40.44%) 1 Month: +184.92 (+32.98%) AMD RETURNS YTD: -7.06 (-7.70%) 1 Year: +30.61 (+56.64%) 6 Months: -11.27 (-11.75%) 1 Month: +10.21 (+13.72%) INTEL RETURNS YTD: +5.85 (+11.74%) 1 Year: -4.41 (-7.34%) 6 Months: +8.21 (+17.30%) 1 Month: +0.83 (+1.51%) NVIDIA beats Intel and AMD in every single category growth wise showing complete dominance with its stock price. Concluding I believe NVIDIA is a must buy presplit and the risk is minimum. The stock shows solid uptrend with extreme growth to come. NVIDIA is a strong buy in my personal opinion and an amazing company to be invested in.. NVDIA DD: Undervalued and why it will continue to run"
